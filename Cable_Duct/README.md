## Stronger cable duct

Creation inspired by different existing elements for cable crossings.
We were tired of seeing the clips break with each disassembly (as rare as they may be, it's never pleasant)

Different lengths are to come. For each length, be sure to print the number of clips needed.

For the printing of clips, support and raft are necessary.
